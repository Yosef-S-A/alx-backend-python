# 0x01-python_async_function

In this project, I learned about:
+ async and await syntax
+ How to execute an async program with asyncio
+ How to run concurrent coroutines
+ How to create asyncio tasks
+ How to use the random module

## Tasks 
+ [0. The basics of async](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-backend-python/tree/main/0x01-python_async_function): asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.
+ [1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async]()
